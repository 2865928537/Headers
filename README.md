# License
Hikari is relicensed from Obfuscator-LLVM and LLVM upstream's permissive NCSA license to GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 with exceptions listed below. tl;dr: The obfuscated LLVM IR and/or obfuscated binary is not restricted in anyway, however **any other project containing code from Hikari needs to be open source and licensed under AGPLV3 as well, even for web-based obfuscation services**. __**Even if your project doesn't contain any code from Hikari but rather linked to Libraries/Object Files containing code from Hikari, you'll still need to open-source your project under AGPLV3**__ , according to AGPLV3 License Text which you should have known in the beginning but I didn't explain carefully before

## Exceptions
- Anyone who has associated with ByteDance in anyway at any past, current, future time point is prohibited from direct using this piece of software or create any derivative from it
